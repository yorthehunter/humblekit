  Use `.flex` to extend the `.container` class and allow a fully flexible,
  100% width container that still pads the sides appropriately. Totally
  works well with the grid classes, too.

  Use `.contain-to-N to` extend the `.container` class to set a max width for
  a particular container. By default, the `.container` class contains to xl.

  **For example:** Maybe a text-heavy section will read better when contained to
  a "md" size, but the header and footer can remain contained to "xl" size.
