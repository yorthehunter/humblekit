    %p 'I want a clean cup,' interrupted the Hatter: 'let's all move one place  on.'
    %p He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare  moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather unwillingly took  the place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any  advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than  before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.
    %p Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very  cautiously: 'But I don't understand. Where did they draw the treacle  from?'

    %p 'I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked.
    %p 'Don't be impertinent,' said the King, 'and don't look at me like that!'  He got behind Alice as he spoke.

    %p The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small.  'Off with his head!' she said, without even looking round.

    %p Of the falling of the fifth cylinder I have presently to tell.  The sixth star fell at Wimbledon.  My brother, keeping watch beside the women in the chaise in a meadow, saw the green flash of it far beyond the hills.  On Tuesday the little party, still set upon getting across the sea, made its way through the swarming country towards Colchester. The news that the Martians were now in possession of the whole of London was confirmed.  They had been seen at Highgate, and even, it was said, at Neasden.  But they did not come into my brother's view until the morrow.

    %p As they grew hungry the rights of property ceased to be regarded.  Farmers were out to defend their cattle-sheds, granaries, and ripening root crops with arms in their hands. A number of people now, like my brother, had their faces eastward, and there were some desperate souls even going back towards London to get food. These were chiefly people from the northern suburbs, whose knowledge of the Black Smoke came by hearsay.  He heard that about half the members of the government had gathered at Birmingham, and that enormous quantities of high explosives wereh being prepared to be used in automatic mines across the Midland counties.head!' she said, without even looking round.
